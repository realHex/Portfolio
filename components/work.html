            <p>I created my Youtube channel when I was 11 years old (2016). I always loved making content
                and sharing stuff that I knew, so editing was really fun for me. I mostly made gaming videos, tutorials and editing packs
                (so that other people can use them when they are editing).
            </p>
            <p>I have stopped editing currently, but I do plan on returning sometime very soon :)</p>
